    "<h2>Financial Markets</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In economics, a financial market is a mechanism that brings people together to buy and sell (trade) financial securities (such as sotcks and bonds(, commodities (such as precious metals or agricultural good), currencies, and other fungible items of value.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>By bringing buyers and sellers together in one place they can trade more efficiently, reducing costs, and share information, resulting in fairer pricing.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>For more information read: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Markets</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Markets are \"places\" where people come together to trade goods; having a common currency facilitates this exchange.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Financial securities</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Financial securities are tradeable assets dealind with the exchange of money and ownership, e.g.,\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li>currencies: monies of various countries held in trust</li>\n",
    "        <li>equities: ownership shares of business entities</li>\n",
    "        <li>debts: contracts for either the right or obligation to either buy or sell another security.</li>\n",

    "<h2>Quantitative Finance</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>Quantitative Finance is an applied discipline dealing with the application of mathematical techniques to decision problems in finance. We can divide these problems into two main branches: (1) the pricing of individual financial securities or opportunities and (2) the management of portfolios of such securities and opportunities. Ultimately, such analyses rest on the estimation of cash-flows across time and of the uncertainties associated with those cash-flows.</b></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Investment Analysis | Financial Modeling</h3>\n",
    " \n",
    "<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)\" target=\"_blank\">Investment analysis</a> or financial modeling is the process of both describing and valuing a financial security or opportunity:\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li>Through comparison with other financial securities or opportunities available to an economic agent, under the presumption that like benefits, costs, and risks will result in like prices, or;</li>\n",
    "        <li>By economic analysis based on market dynamics and equilibrium conditions which are posited or observed to exist in financial markets or the larget economy.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "These two approaches are not mutually exclusive, however, and financial modeling usually involves elements of both. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Investment Management | Portfolio Management</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management\" target=\"_blank\">Investment management</a> or portfolio management is the creation and continued management of a portfolio of various investments to meet the economic goals of investors. It typically involves the trade-off of two aspects of investment performance at specified time horizons.\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li><i>Reward</i> is represented by various measures which describe the economic benefits realized by the portfolio over time. The simplest example is the expected return of the portfolio.</li>\n",
    "        <li><i>Risk</i> is represented by various measures which describe the uncertainties associated with economic returns realized by the portfolio. The simplest example is the volatility (or variance) of the return of the portfolio.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<h3>The Comparison Principle</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Some investments can be evaluated by comparint them with other available investments. Financial markets, in particular, have features that allow us to quantify and compare different alternatives in purely economic terms.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Arbitrage</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>An <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage\" target=\"_blank\">arbitrage</a>, put simply, is a risk-free profit. when one talks about a market being \"fair\", that usually means arbitrage is impossible.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Mispricing example</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Consider an agent who buys an asset for a given price in one market and then simultaneously sells the identical asset for a higher price in another. Sometimes this makes sense, e.g., one market might be near the asset's producers and the other near its consumers. However, if the two markets are equivalent, then the agent can make a theoretically infinite riskless profit by continuously buying in the \"cheap\" market and selling in the expensive one.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4> Coommodity Pricing Example</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Consider the pricing of bushels of winter wheat which are sold on an organized commodities market (example: https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/wheat_contract_specifications.html). Each bushel of wheat is much like any other (i.e., they are fungible) and the balance of supply and demand will reveal a price. Regardless of whether a person thinks the price of wheat will rise or fall in the future, there is no basis for one person to buy or sell wheat at a different price than any other person.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4> Risk-free rate</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>There is a risk-free rate that represents a floor at which one can borrow or lend money. There can be only one risk-free rate; otherwise, a person could borrow at the lower rate and invest at the higher, making an infinite riskless return.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This doesn't mean that earning more than the risk-free rate is impossible, only that it cannot be guaranteed. The arbitrage-free assumption means that there is no certain reward in excess of this without some risk.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3> Uncertainty and Risk Aversion in Markets</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>There are many sources of uncertainty in markets. Consider a share of stock in a company; the price is affected by factors internal to the company (e.g., its earnings) and outside the company (e.g., inflation).</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>All else being equal, a rational investor prefers a less risky alternative to a more risky one.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Theory of Interest</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b> Cash that one has today is worth more than the same amount of cash in the future. This is the <i>time value of money</i>. If one borrows $F$ today one must pay $(F+rF)$, $r>0$, in the future so that the value of the amount borrowed equals the value of the amount paid. This factor $r$ is called the interest rate. </b></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Cash flow diagrams</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Cash flow diagrams are a simple, but extremely useful, tool for visualizing the cash flows associated with many investment problems.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Single Payment Example</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The cash flow diagram for a situation in which someone borrows $\\$100.00$ today and pays off the loan with a single payment of $\\$105.00$ after one year is</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Images/img1.png\" width = 300 height = 200>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The additional $\\$5.00$ is, of course, the interest paid on the load and represents an interest rate of $5\\%$.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4> Multiple Payments Example</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example would be a case in which the borrower borrows $\\$100$ and pays back the load with two payments, one at six months and the other at a year, of $\\$51.88$ each. the cash flow diagram is that case would be \n",

    "\n",
    "The additional $\\$1.88 + \\$1.88 = \\$ 3.76$ represents the interest on the loan. Computing the interest rate here is slightly more complicated and will be covered shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loan: A Contract to Borrow Money Now and Repay it in the Future\n",
    "\n",
    "A loan is a contract: the loaner gives the borrower a certain amount of money; the borrower agrees to repay this amount plus interest by making payments at specified points in time until the principal (the amount borrowed) plus interest is paid off.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Frank loans $\\$100$ at $10\\%$ annual interest for 4 years to Andrea. \n",

    "### Markets for cash\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Savings deposits\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest is the demand deposit, in which the cash must be return upon the demand of the owner. The other alternates, time deposit accounts and certificates of deposite, require the funds to remain for a fixed period of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Money market instruments\n",
    "\n",
    "These are short-term borrowing by corporations or banks. The term commercial paper is used to describe unsecurer loads of this type. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### U.S. Government securities\n",
    "\n",
    "These are a form of what is called <i>sovereign debt</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>U.S. Treasury bills</b>: Issued in denominations of $\\$10,000$ or more and fixed maturities of 12, 26, and 52 weeks. They are sold at discount. Thus, for example, a $\\$10,000$ 12-week bill at a $5\\%$ yield would be sold for $$\\frac{10000}{1+\\frac{0.05}{4}} = 9876.54$$\n",
    "* <b> U.S. Treasury notes</b>: Have maturities of 1 to 10 years and are sold in denominations of $\\$1000$ or more. The holder receives a fixed coupon payment every six months until the end of the term at which time the holder receives the final coupon payment and the return of the face or principal amount of the note. \n",
    "* <b> U.S. Treasury bonds</b>: Have maturities of 10 years or more. They make semi-annual coupon payments like Treasury notes, but are callable, i.e., at scheduled coupon payment dates the Treasury can call the bond, redeeming it by returning the face amount at that time. \n",
    "* <b> U.S. Trasury strips</b>: aer Treasuris whose coupon and principal payments have been stripped into separate instruments. For example, a $\\$1000$, 10-year bond would be stripped into its 20 coupon payments plus its principal.

The interest income is exempt from Deferal taxes and from state and local taxes in the issuing state. This allows government agencies to pay a lower rate than other borrowers. \n",
    "* <b>Corporate bonds</b>: are issud by corporations to raise capital for their oprations and capital projects. Depending upon de borrower, such bonds carry varying risks of default, i.e., failure of the issuer to repay the debt.

    "* Subordination of debt occurts when other more senior debt must be paid off first. More senior debt obviously carries less risk than less senior debt. \n",

    "### Commercial Mortgages\n",
    "\n",
    "In some instances, especially when commercial property is involved, the mortgage payment is computed based on a terms $n_{\\textrm{amort}}$ but the actual term of the loan is $n$, where $n_{\\textrm{amort}} > n$. At the end of $n$ years the final payment is a balloon that consists of the month's payment plus the unpaid portion of the principal. These mortgages are attractive to the bank because it can offer a competitive fixed-rate without committing itself to that rate over a long period of time. The borrower normally expects to remortgage the property at time $n$ at the mortgage rate available in the market at that time. \n",

    "## Bonds\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>A <a href ='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)' target ='_blank'>bond </a> is a debt secutiry, a contract to repay borrowed money plus interest. The borrower is called the <i> issuer</i> of the bond. The lender is called the <i>holder</i> of the bond. Short-term debt instruments such as certificates of deposit (CD) are not considered bonds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bonds are used commercially to secure external capital without diluting the ownership of the business and are usually issued for purposes of long-term investment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Governments and governmental agencies also issue bonds, which may be used to fund either long-term projects such as schools or bridges, or to fund shortfalls in current expenditures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bonds typically have a defined term, or maturity, and a fixed schedule of interest payments, called the rm<i>coupons</i>. At the end of the term the face amount of the bond is repaid. Am exeption is a consol bond, which is an agreement to pay the coupon in perpetuity.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> <b> Price</b>: the amount the bond holder (the lender) agrees to pay the issuer (the borrower)_ to own the bon at origination, or the price a pruchaser has to pay in the secondary market to own the bond.</li>\n",
    "    <li> <b> Par or face value</b>: the amount the coupon payment is based and, usually, the amount the bond issuer agrees to pay the bond holder at redemption. </li>\n",
    "    <li> <b> Term</b>: the time over which the obligations represented by the bond exist. </li>\n",
    "    <li> <b> Rate of interest</b>: the interest, usually expressed as an annual rate, paid on the face amount of the bond.</li>\n",
    "    <li> <b> Payment frequency </b>: the number of times each year the bond pays.</li>\n",
    "    <li> <b> Coupon</b>: the periodic payment of the bon; usually an interest payment based on the face amount, interest rate, and payment frequency.</li>\n",
    "    <li> <b> Yield</b>: the IRR of the bond at the market price. Yield, rather than price, is the primary measure to value and compare bonds in the market.</li>\n",
    "    <li> <b> Premium or Discount </b> A bond that is sold at origination at a price higher than its par value is said to sell at a premium. If less, at a discount.</li>\n",
    "    <li> <b> Rating</b>: is a measure of how likely the bond is to default; ratings are usually standardized (see, for example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_credit_rating\" target=\"_blank\">bond credit rating </a>). The lower the rating, the higher the interest rate that must be paid to compensate the lender for the additional risk.</li>\n",

    "<p>In what follows we will assume a standard bond priced at $S$ with face vaue $F$, interest rate $t$, term $n$, and frequency $k$. The coupon $c$ is calculated from the face value, annual rate and frequency:\n",
    "$$c = \\frac{Fr}{k}, \\ c = FRq,$$\n",
    "where $q$ is, as usual, the inverse of $k$. </p>\n",

This is to facilitate the comparison of different bonds that have different underlying structures. The price of the bond is the <i>PV of the finite stream of coupon payments</i> plus the <i>PV of the final payment of the face amount</i>, discounted at the yield of the bond:</p>\n",

    "        <li> $y = r$: The bond is sold at <i>par</i>, and its IRR matches the coupon rate. This implies that the coupon rate of the bond matches the market's rate, the yield, used the price this instrument. The PV of the cash-flows matches the face amount. </li>\n",
    "        <li> $y < r$: the bond is sold at a <i>premiu</i>, and the coupon rate of the bond is greater than the market yield. The PV of the cash-flows is higher than the face amount. </li>\n",

They were originally developed pre-computers to assist in assessing the impact of yield changes. Now such changes can be quickly calculated exactly.
